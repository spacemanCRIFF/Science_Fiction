        <div class="Two2">Love, Death + Robots is a 5-time Emmy winning animation anthology series produced by Blur Studio. Launched 
            in March of 2019 on Netflix, Love, Death + Robots delivers a variety of style and story unlike anything else, spanning the 
            genres of science fiction, fantasy, comedy, horror, and more. Created by Tim Miller with David Fincher as executive producer, 
            the series brings together a global team of directors and animation studios to push and expand the medium. Eighteen shorts in all, 
            Love, Death + Robots has something for everyone. The first season is almost perfection. Most of its individual episodes 
            have great stories and meaning behind them, they have originality. Even the worst episodes in season one are watchable and have some 
            level of entertainment. The first season has lots of re-watchability to it. But then they released the second season. It's got plenty 
            of episodes with cool concepts but they drag on. I, and many other people, felt let-down by the subsequent season. So far it only has 
            eight episodes, and those eight episodes feel like they were episodes cut from the first season. It isn't horrible, but once you see 
            it all, you don't want to watch it again. Its worst episodes are unbearable and its best are inferior compared to the first season. 
            It contains episodes where the characters make dumb decisions, and its got plenty of episodes that are hard to understand.  Absolute
            gems from Season 1 include Three Robots, Beyond the Aquila Rift, and Good Hunting.</div>

        <div class="Five2">An anthology series exploring a twisted, high-tech multiverse where humanity's greatest innovations and darkest 
            instincts collide. Set in a world only minutes from our own, "Black Mirror" unveils how modern technologies can backfire and be 
            used against their makers, every episode set in a slightly different reality with different characters combating different types 
            of technologies. Over the last ten years, technology has transformed almost every aspect of our lives before we've had time to stop 
            and question it. In every home; on every desk; in every palm - a plasma screen; a monitor; a smartphone--a black mirror of our 21st 
            Century existence. Black Mirror is a contemporary British anthology series with stories that tap into the collective unease about our 
            modern world.<br>
            The show looks inwards, at the darker aspects of humanity and society. This is done through the theme of technology, hence the second 
            meaning. The black mirror is the screen that rules our lives. Taking contemporary phenomena (ranging from the wild popularity of talent 
            shows on TV to the impact of social media and smartphones on our lives) as a starting point and speculate how such phenomena could/would 
            evolve in the future. Each episode tells a different story with different protagonists and focuses on a different theme. Black Mirror is 
            delightfully dark and often set in a cyberpunk dystopia.  Two espically poignant episodes are San Junipero and Nosedive, the 
            latter starring Bryce Dallas Howard.</div>
        <div class="Six2">He may have died 35 years ago, but Philip K. Dick’s influence is everywhere in 2018. It’s not just the rippling success of 
            “Blade Runner 2049,” the growing fan base of Amazon’s “The Man in the High Castle,” or the Dick-influenced “Black Mirror”—he now literally 
            has a show with his name on it, a star-studded anthology series that adapts (sometimes loyally, more often very loosely) ten of his short 
            stories. “Electric Dreams” is hit-and-miss, but the hits far outweigh the misses. A large majority of “Electric Dreams” is worth your time, 
            especially if you’re a fan of Dick’s work, with only one episode that really misfires, offset by one that’s a mini-masterpiece. And the eight 
            in between are what could safely be called “pretty good.” Given the wild peaks and valleys of “Black Mirror,” to which this show is sure to be 
            compared, the consistency here makes for arguably a better series overall. The ten episodes feel less reliant on “Twilight Zone”-esque twists and more concerned with philosophical issues about what it 
            means to be human. They’re less likely to serve as cautionary tales of tech addiction (as Charlie Brooker’s show does) than they are to question the 
            complexity of the human race. Even though the series can seem uneven, most everybody else will be able to find something to satisfy them in Electric 
            Dreams as it winds its way through varied storytelling styles, littered with intriguing actors and exploding with creative visual flourishes.</div>
