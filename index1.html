        <div class="Three">Stargate: Atlantis was set up with the seventh season finale of Stargate SG-1, "Lost City, Part 2", 
            in which SG-1 discovers an advanced outpost, built by the Ancients, under the ice of Antarctica. It is through this 
            outpost that, in Stargate: Atlantis' series premiere "Rising", an eight symbol gate address is found that leads to 
            the long-sought-after "Lost City" of the Ancients— also known as Atlantis. The search for this city had been an ongoing 
            theme since the sixth season of Stargate SG-1.  An international expedition is thus sent through the Stargate to the far 
            off Pegasus galaxy where the Ancient City-ship Atlantis resides. However, soon after the discovery of this grand city, a 
            terrible enemy known as the Wraith is awakened. Throughout the series, the Wraith serve as the main antagonists, with the 
            Atlantis expedition being the protagonists. The ultimate driving force of the series is the protection of Atlantis and the 
            discovery of advanced Ancient technology, continuing the SGC's original mandate.
            The show itself has the same feel as the later seasons of Stargate SG-1 in that the overall atmosphere is light, with the 
            exception of more serious moments. Stargate: Atlantis brings us an epic and intergalactic story arc with amazing characters.

        <div class="Four">Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) focuses on the 24th century adventures of Captain Jean-Luc Picard aboard the 
            U.S.S. Enterprise (NCC-1701-D).  This incarnation of the famous starship is much larger than the one captained by James T. Kirk 
            a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, women…and, surprisingly, children. This era’s 
            Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their 
            ship as home. Thus, Picard’s crew enjoys many of the comforts they would have
            </div>
        <div class="Five"></div>
        <div class="Six">otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, “replicated” food dishes to suit every 
            palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring.  There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with 
            synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind.  However, the ongoing mission—no longer limited to a mere five years—remains 
            virtually the same as it was during Kirk’s time: to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before.
            Many consider Star Trek: TNG to be the best of all Star Trek.</div>
        <div class="Seven">Star Trek: Voyager (VOY) focuses on the 24th century adventures of Captain Kathryn Janeway aboard the U.S.S. Voyager.  
            Smaller than either Kirk’s or Picard’s starships—its crew complement is only 150—Voyager is fast and powerful, and has the ability to 
            land on a planet’s surface.  It is one of the most technologically advanced vessels in Starfleet, utilizing computer circuitry that 
            incorporates synthetic neural tissue.  Ironically, Janeway’s inaugural mission aboard Voyager was to be her last in the Alpha quadrant.  
            While attempting to capture the crew of a renegade Maquis vessel, both her ship and that of the Maquis were pulled into the distant Delta 
            quadrant by powerful alien technology.  Unfortunately, there would be no similar “express” route to take them home again.  Stranded 70,000 
            light-years from Earth, Janeway convinced the Maquis to join her Starfleet crew and serve together during the long voyage back to Federation 
            space. Star Trek: Voyager is dynamic with Captain Janeway stoicly leading the crew through ongoing uncertainties and perils related to being 
            stranded in the delta quadrant, and the seemingly unsumountable distance home.  Bonds are formed that feel stronger than Star Trek series.</div>
